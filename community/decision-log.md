## Revise Argo CLA to follow CNCF guidelines

### Date

2020 Sep 19

### Context

Now that the Argo Project is a part of the CNCF, we should revise the Argo CLA to follow CNCF guidelines.

### Decision

We will move from the current Argo Individual and Corporate CLAs to the DCO.

https://developercertificate.org/

### Rationale

CNCF provides support for implementing both the DCO and CLA. Choice of one over the other is left to each CNCF project. Neither is currently viewed as providing stronger legal protection than the other.

The Linux kernal as well as most CNCF projects use the DCO. The DCO is viewed as a more developer-friendly alternative to the CLA.

### Dissenting Opinions
